## Streamlining My Homelab Setup: A Technical Guide

### Introduction
This is the first in a series of four posts documenting my structured approach to optimizing and automating my Homelab environment. The project aims to methodically set up a Homelab using readily available hardware, such as a Raspberry Pi or any old PC/laptop that can be repurposed. Setting up a Homelab can be daunting, with approaches ranging from simple manual setups to full-scale private cloud implementations. My approach strikes a balance, leveraging existing resources and progressively implementing automation to ensure easy maintenance and intervention when issues arise.

I will explore two main dimensions: utilizing free or inexpensive automation tools and service offerings, and identifying optional steps where professional solutions could be integrated. The initial assumption is that you have a x64 PC/laptop capable of running Ubuntu. Additional devices will be introduced throughout the guides to practice key concepts, such as clustering.

### Project Overview
Since this project involves getting acquainted with several technology stacks, my initial approach is to ensure I have a few essential services up and running on my home network. For this purpose, I found an old Lenovo ThinkPad T480 laptop running Windows. (These laptops are readily available online and are a good start for such projects due to their affordability and reliability.)

Although the usual target for such projects is using Linux, I chose Windows because it is typically pre-installed and licensed on these devices, making it an accessible starting point. I installed Plex Media Server and used the built-in Hyper-V feature to set up a simple Docker Compose file within an Ubuntu VM. This setup allows me to test a few key concepts and actually having and understand how I can leverage this project effectively. Running Docker on Windows requires some tweaking, especially for Linux containers, but there are numerous guides available online. Approaches such as setting up a Linux VM, using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), and other methods provide flexibility in how you can achieve this.





### Steps and Methodology
1. **Defining Requirements:** Begin with a comprehensive outline of the projectâ€™s goals, current infrastructure, desired outcomes, and any constraints.
2. **Designing the Topology:** Utilize Microsoft Whiteboard to draft a visual representation of the network topology. This visualization will map out the interactions between various components and ensure a thorough understanding of the system.
3. **Setting Up Infrastructure:** Decommission old hosts on L1 and set up new hosts on L2 and L3. This phase will be meticulously planned to prevent any service disruption.
4. **Automating Processes:** Implement Tinkerbell and Packer to automate installation and configuration tasks. This will enhance efficiency, reduce manual errors, and ensure consistency.
5. **Documentation:** Maintain an open repository on GitHub to document each step, share insights, and track progress. This transparent approach aims to benefit the technical community by providing a reference for similar projects.

### Detailed Breakdown
#### Defining Requirements
A clear understanding of the requirements is crucial. This involves gathering information on the current state of the Homelab, identifying the goals, and noting any dependencies or constraints.

#### Designing the Topology
Creating a visual draft using Microsoft Whiteboard will help in conceptualizing the network architecture. This step is vital for ensuring that all components are accounted for and that the interaction between them is clear.

#### Setting Up Infrastructure
The transition from old hosts to new ones must be executed with precision. This phase will involve setting up new hosts on L2 and L3, ensuring all configurations are correctly applied, and monitoring the transition to prevent downtime.

#### Automating Processes
Automation tools such as Tinkerbell and Packer will be employed to handle repetitive tasks. This will not only speed up the setup process but also ensure a high level of consistency and reliability.

#### Documentation
Every step of the process will be documented in an open GitHub repository. This will include detailed descriptions, configuration files, and any relevant scripts. The goal is to create a comprehensive resource that others in the technical community can refer to.

### Conclusion
By following this structured approach, I aim to achieve a streamlined and automated Homelab setup. This documentation will serve as a guide for anyone looking to undertake a similar project, providing valuable insights and practical steps.
